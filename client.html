<p>Shiva (Siva) is one of the most important gods in the Hindu pantheon and is considered a member of the holy trinity (trimurti) of Hinduism with Brahma and Vishnu. A complex character, he may represent goodness, benevolence and serve as the Protector. He is also associated with Time, and particularly as the destroyer and creator of all things.</p>

For example, in the Hanuman Chalisa, Hanuman is identified as the eleventh avatar of Shiva.[332][333][334] The Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana claim sage Durvasa to be a portion of Shiva.[335][336][337] Some medieval era writers have called the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara an incarnation of Shiva.[</td>

                      <p >The Linga Purana states, "Shiva is signless, without color, taste, smell, that is beyond word or touch, without quality, motionless and changeless".[302] The source of the universe is the signless, and all of the universe is the manifested Linga, a union of unchanging Principles and the ever changing nature.[302] The Linga Purana and Siva Gita texts builds on this foundation.[303][304] Linga, states Alain Dani√©lou, means sign.[302] It is an important concept in Hindu texts, wherein Linga is a manifested sign and nature of someone or something. It accompanies the concept of Brahman, which as invisible signless and existent Principle, is formless or linga-less.[302]</p>
